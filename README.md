Package Installer Exercise

Description:

You suddenly have a curious aspiration to create a package installer that can handle dependencies. You want to be able to give the installer a
list of packages with dependencies, and have it install the packages in order such that an install won’t fail due to a missing dependency.
This exercise is to write the code that will determine the order of install.

Requirements:

Please use Test Driven Development (TDD) and include your tests.
The program should accept an array of strings defining packages and their dependencies. Each string contains the name of a
package followed by a colon and space then any dependencies required by that package. For simplicity we’ll assume that a package
can have at most one dependency.
The program should reject as invalid a dependency specification that contains cycles.
The program should output a comma separated string of package names in the order of install, such that a package’s dependency will
always precede that package.

Examples:

VALID INPUT EXAMPLE 1

[ "KittenService: CamelCaser", "CamelCaser: " ]

represents two packages, KittenService and CamelCaser, where KittenService depends on CamelCaser. In this case the output should be:
"CamelCaser, KittenService"

The output indicates that CamelCaser needs to be installed before KittenService.



VALID INPUT EXAMPLE 2

["KittenService: ", "Leetmeme: Cyberportal", "Cyberportal: Ice", "CamelCaser: KittenService", "Fraudstream: Leetmeme", "Ice: "]

A valid output for the above input would be:
"KittenService, Ice, Cyberportal, Leetmeme, CamelCaser, Fraudstream"



INVALID INPUT EXAMPLE

The following input should be rejected because it contains a cycle (Leetmeme -> Cyberportal -> Ice -> Leetmeme):

["KittenService: ", "Leetmeme: Cyberportal", "Cyberportal: Ice", "CamelCaser: KittenService", "Fraudstream: ", "Ice: Leetmeme"]
